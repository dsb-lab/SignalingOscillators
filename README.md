# Signaling Oscillators

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce part of the work shown in the article: "_Casani-Galdon, P.; Garcia-Ojalvo, J. Signaling oscillations: Molecular mechanisms and functional roles. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2022, 78, 102130_".

The repository contains the following files:
* [`figure1.jl`](figure1.jl): Julia program that generates de time traces for panel B of figure 1.
* [`figure2.jl`](figure2.jl): Julia program that generates de time traces for panel C of figure 2.
* [`figure3.jl`](figure3.jl): Julia program that generates de time traces for panel C of figure 3.

Results of runing `$ julia figureX.jl` are stored under the `figures/figureX` folder together with the definitive figures of the article.
